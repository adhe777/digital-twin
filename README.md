# Digital Twin for Personal Productivity

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This application acts as a "Digital Twin" for students—a virtual reflection of your daily habits. By tracking key metrics like sleep, study hours, screen time, and mood, the system uses AI to:
1.  **Analyze** your productivity and burnout risk.
2.  **Simulate** the future impact of habit changes (e.g., "What if I sleep 1 hour more?").
3.  **Recommend** personalized actions to improve your academic performance and well-being.
